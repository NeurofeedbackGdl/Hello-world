# Hello-world
Learning how to create a repository
I am Carolina, from Jalisco, MÃ©xico. I have been worked for about 10 years in neurofeedback classic and Z scores method. Noww I want to learn and implement both: "virtual and physical objects via machine learning of trained mental commands". I am very glad to be here.
